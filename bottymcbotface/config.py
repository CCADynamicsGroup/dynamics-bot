Hi all,

Tomorrow's CCA Galactic Dynamics Community Meeting will be 14:00â€“15:30 Eastern in the 5th floor classroom.

We will kick off the meeting with very short introductions, then hear from (( NAME 1 )) and (( NAME 2 )) in the first half of the meeting.

For the second half of the meeting, everyone is invited to share a figure, a research update, a paper (from someone else!), an announcement, fun news, etc. If you plan to share something, please add a slide to this slide deck:

{slide_deck_url}

If you have not been added to the visitor list for the CCA, please email Adrian (aprice-whelan@flatironinstitute.org) by 15:00 today or you may not be able to enter the building!
